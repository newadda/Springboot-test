  # static-quorum defines a fixed number of nodes, and a network partition must have at least
  #  this number of reachable nodes (in a given role, if that is specified) in order to be allowed
  #  to survive. If the quorum size is picked bigger than half the maximum number of cluster nodes,
  #  this strategy is completely robust. It does not however work well with a dynamically growing
  #  (or shrinking) cluster.
  #
  # keep-majority uses the number of cluster nodes as the baseline and requires a network partition
  #  to have more than half that number of (reachable) nodes in order to be allowed to survive. This
  #  fully supports elastically growing and shrinking clusters, but there are rare race conditions
  #  that can lead to both partitions to be downed or - potentially worse - both partitions to survive.
  #
  # keep-oldest requires the oldest member to be part of a partition for it to survive. This can be
  #  useful since the oldest node is where cluster singletons are running, so this strategy does not
  #  singletons to be migrated and restarted. It reliably prevents split brain, but it can lead to
  #  a situation where 2 nodes survive and 25 nodes are downed. To deal with the pathological special
  #  case that the oldest node is in a network partition of its own, the flag 'down-if-alone' can be
  #  used to specify the oldest node if it is all by itself.
